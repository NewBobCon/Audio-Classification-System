# Audio-Classification-System
Assignment 4 of CSS 484 Multimedia and Data processing class

Steps to run the program:

Make sure all the files from the repisitory are in the same directory.
You may change the audio files in each folder but make sure they are consistent with the category of each.

Open the repisotory on Vscode or any IDE.

If on Vscode, simply run a python3 FileViewer.py command to run the program.

This will open up a page where you will be prompted to select the (about) 2/3 of the files to create the model with.
Next you will be expected to Compute once all files for the model are chosen.
After a few seconds, a window with the results of the test files, which are automatically being chosen as the files
that were not checked, will pop up and you will be able to see the results.

Thank you for running our program!
